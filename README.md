I like listening to Triple J, so i made a brief program that runs on a 1 minute cron and stores the data in a db. From here, i can look over the data and end up with a unique set of the songs played on the radio and understand how often they're played. The ultimate goal is to be able to re-play the radio using an online streaming service such as Grooveshark.
